# Ben's pages

A collection of documents exploring computer topics.
Their purpose is to refresh a memory about a particular topic.

The notes employ a _Three's Complexity_ model. Some documents explore as far as
three paragraphs whereas a larger document might expand each paragraph further.

Appended to each document will be additional reading material and my personal
insights. They are there to assist the reader in forming their own conclusions.
