# Ben's pages

A collection of pages that explore computing topics.  
They intend to convey an understanding that others may find useful.

These pages use a model called Three's Complexity. Some pages explore a topic
as far as three paragraphs, whereas a larger document might expand on each
paragraph further.

Appended to each document will be additional reading material and my personal
insights. They are there to assist the reader in their own research and
conclusions.
